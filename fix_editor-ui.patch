Subject: [PATCH] fix: When translation is needed, the page console prompts null data.
---
# This patch is no longer needed as the fix has been incorporated into n8n core
# Starting from version n8n@1.114.3, the null check is already present in the code
# The patch is kept for compatibility with older versions but will be skipped for newer ones
